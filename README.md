# C++ Exam Exercise

### What is this?
This repository contains the code for a C++ exam I wrote during my first semester of DAE.

### How does it work?
The goal of the game is to get to the end point.
The player can use the arrow keys to move to different nodes, each node shows a progress bar that moves up and down.
You can only step on nodes that are half full to full, when moving to a wrong node the player is returned to the start point.
